The Changing Man begins like a deep premeditation of something heavy about to go down, like the intensifying determination of someone mission~bound. Lyrically, the songs seem like dark contemplations with psychedelic undertones; somewhat mystical and reminiscent of the Doors (think, The End). Musically, Sweven leans towards a heavy stoner vibe. 8/10. Favorite track: (Shades Of) The Changing Man."
